Concepts Learnt:
-----------------
1. Also for prev/next pointer access, check if the node obj on which prev/next is invoked is not null
2. always update head/tail/curr pointer in each operation
3. To make a node eligible for delete via gc from existing chain, the prev/next pointer of the node to be deleted should also need to be explicitly set to null

🔹 Basic-Level DLL Questions
------------------------------
Implement a Doubly Linked List from scratch.

-> Basic Operations: insert at head, insert at tail, delete node, search node.
Asked by: Amazon, Barclays

-> Reverse a Doubly Linked List.
-> In-place reversal by swapping next and prev.

Asked by: JPMorgan, PayPal

-> Delete a node in a Doubly Linked List.

Given a reference to a node, delete it.
Asked by: Walmart, AMEX

-> Insert a node at a specific position in a DLL.
-> Handle edge cases (start, end, middle).

Asked by: Uber, Swiggy

==============================================================================

🔹 Intermediate-Level DLL Questions
------------------------------------
-> A. Check if a Doubly Linked List is a palindrome.

-> Use two pointers: head and tail.

Asked by: Google, JPMorgan

-> B. Find pairs with a given sum in a sorted DLL.

Similar to 2-pointer approach in arrays.

Asked by: PayPal, Barclays

-> C. Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list.
Each node may have a child pointer pointing to a separate doubly linked list.

Asked by: Amazon, Meta

-> D. Convert Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List.
In-order traversal-based conversion.

Asked by: Microsoft, Netflix

🔹 Advanced-Level DLL Questions
------------------------------
-> A. LRU Cache implementation using Doubly Linked List + HashMap.
->    A classic design problem testing DLL and hash table combination.

Asked by: Amazon, Google, Uber, PayPal

-> B. Design a data structure supporting O(1) insert, delete, and getRandom operations (with DLL & HashMap).
-> RandomizedSet/RandomizedCollection.
Asked by: Facebook, JPMorgan

-> C. Implement an All O(1) Data Structure.
Maintains frequency of elements, requires DLL of frequency buckets.
Asked by: Google, Meta

-> D. Copy a doubly linked list with random pointer.
Variation of the deep copy with mapping.
Asked by: Amazon, Swiggy, PayPal

-> Browser History / Undo-Redo using Doubly Linked List
Asked in system design rounds at Meta, Uber.

-> Design a music playlist system (like Spotify) with skip-next/previous functionality
Asked by: Netflix, Zomato
